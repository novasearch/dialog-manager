# TWIZ Dialog Manager Framework

## Description
This framework enables you to build a dialog manager that is easily modified and extended, which leverages a state machine
pattern in order to give contextual responses to user input and maintain a correct conversation flow.

## Usage
To learn more about its usage check its **documentation** [here](https://twiz-dialog-manager.readthedocs.io/).

An **example** of an implementation of a dialog manager using this framework can be found under [/example](/example). 
After reading the documentation, to create a first version of your state machine, you can make use of a
[generation tool](https://github.com/irsimoes/dialog-manager-generator).
